# Math Theorem Prover 

This repository contains formal proofs of 5 problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 
using the Isabelle theorem prover. Each problem is carefully proven step-by-step, 
showcasing the use of Isabelle for solving mathematical challenges.  
It was part of the **Introduction to Interactive Theorem Proving** course in the final year of undergraduate studies


### What is Isabelle?  
- [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) is a generic proof assistant. 
It allows mathematical formulas to be expressed in a formal language 
and provides tools for proving those formulas in a logical calculus. 
Isabelle was originally developed at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/Cambridge/) 
and [Technische Universität München](https://www21.in.tum.de/), but now includes numerous contributions from institutions and individuals worldwide.
