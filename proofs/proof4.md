### Solution

The numbers $x$ and $x - y$ are non-negative (by the condition of the task), so it holds that:

$$x^2 - xy = x(x - y) \geq 1 \cdot (x - y) = x - y$$

(to remove $y$: $x^2 - xy$ -> $x - y$)  

Now we have:

$$0 = 2x^2 - xy - 5x + y + 4 =$$

$$x^2 + x^2 - xy - 5x + y + 4 =$$

$$x^2 + x - y - 5x + y + 4 \geq x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2$$

Thus, $x = 2$. Substituting into the initial equation, we get $y = 2$.
The only solution to the equation is the pair $(x, y) = (2, 2)$.
